## What I'm up to 🥳
I'm a combination guy of Business + Culture + Technology guy. 
I have a dream, I can help Vietnam become a powerful country, and have its own Silicon Valley where everyone loves to learn and share knowledge, especially Technology and Culture!

Currently, my hustle focuses on building [Techmely](https://techmely.com/) and [Kungfutech](https://kungfutech.edu.vn/) with my teams.

## My advantage card(Long mạch - Vietnamese language)?

- I can understand, and organize people to maximize their performance and efficiencies.
- I love Tech, especially Architecture Solutions(newbie). I already built and initiated 5 code bases(Monorepo, micro-frontend, domain-driven design) from 0 commits to 10k commits, 3 persons to more than 30 persons.
- I love to build career paths for the Software Engineer, especially some internal business processes like Software Delivery Assessment... to help organizations happier, more productive, and more profitable.
- A Longlife-Learner - always learning and sharing the news tech or experiences for others!
- Yeah, I and my team build products fast - Release MVP products in 2 weeks(Requirement + Design + UI/UX + Website + Cross-Mobile App).
